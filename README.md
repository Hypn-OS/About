# :triangular_flag_on_post: About The Community
**HypnOS** is a technical group created so that all the members can enrich their skill by participating in technical events like **Hackathons**, **Meetups**, **DevSprints**, **Conferences**, **Talks** and pretty much everything related to tech. Our team will be continuously looking for these types of events happening around time to time and we will be participating as much as we can. As these events are a good place to interact with different technical peoples from across the country or the globe, so this will also help us to grow our networks in industry & among like-minded people.

# :earth_asia: Our Mission
The main mission of the **HypnOS** is to educate and engage more students into various technical events happening around so that they learn and show case their skill set more efficiently, effectively and in less time with external mentorship and help. This will surely help to better understand the larger ecosystem of developer and to be a part of it. Apart form this we are also encouraging members to work in various open source projects and gain knowledge and work experience from it.
